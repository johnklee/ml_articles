    "In this tutorial we are following the paper titled “CNNpred: CNN-based stock market prediction using a iverse set of variables” by Ehsan Hoseinzade and Saman Haratizadeh. The data file and sample code from the author are available in [github](https://github.com/hoseinzadeehsan/CNNpred-Keras).\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>The goal of the paper is simple: To predict the next day’s direction of the stock market</b> (<font color='brown'>i.e., up or down compared to today</font>), hence it is a binary classification problem. However, it is interesting to see how this problem are formulated and solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen the examples on using CNN for sequence prediction. If we consider [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average) (<font color='brown'>DJIA</font>) as an example, we may build a CNN with 1D convolution for prediction. This makes sense because a 1D convolution on a time series is roughly computing its moving average or using digital signal processing terms, applying a filter to the time series. It should provide some clues about the trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, <b>when we look at financial time series, it is quite a common sense that some derived signals are useful for predictions too. For example, price and volume together can provide a better clue. Also some other technical indicators such as the moving average of different window size are useful too</b>. If we put all these align together, we will have a table of data, which each time instance has multiple features, and the goal is still to predict the direction of one time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the CNNpred paper, 82 such features are prepared for the DJIA time series:\n",
