Classify the sentiment of each conversation in >>>>>CONTENT<<<<<
as "negative" and "positive". For the output format:
1. Return the output as valid JSON format.
2. Skip the prefix "```json" from the generated output.

Follow these steps when classifying the conversations:
1. Does the customer use swear words or ðŸ˜¤?
2. Does the customer seem aggravated or angry?

If you answer "Yes" to one of the above questions,
then classify the conversation as "negative".
Otherwise classify the conversation as "positive".

Let's think step by step
