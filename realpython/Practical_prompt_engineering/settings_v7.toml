Classify the sentiment of each conversation in >>>>>CONTENT<<<<<
with "ðŸ”¥" for negative and "âœ…" for positive.

Follow these steps when classifying the conversations:
1. Does the customer use swear words or ðŸ˜¤?
2. Does the customer seem aggravated or angry?

If you answer "Yes" to one of the above questions,
