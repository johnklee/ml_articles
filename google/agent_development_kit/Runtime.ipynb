    "    - <b>Caveat</b>: Relying heavily on dirty reads for critical logic can be risky. <font color='darkred'>If the invocation fails before the event carrying the `state_delta` is yielded and processed by the `Runner`, the uncommitted state change will be lost</font>. For critical state transitions, ensure they are associated with an event that gets successfully processed."
