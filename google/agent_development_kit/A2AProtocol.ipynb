First, `adk api_server --a2a` works with `adk web`, making it easy to use, debug, and test your agent. Second, with `adk api_server`, you can specify a parent folder with multiple, separate agents. Those agents that have an agent card (<font color='olive'>agent.json</font>), will automatically be usable via A2A by other agents through the same server. However, you will need to create your own agent cards. To create an agent card, you can follow the [**A2A Python tutorial**](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/tutorials/python/1-introduction/).\n",
