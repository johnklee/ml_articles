AI agents are suitable when you need AI to complete goal-focused tasks with some degree of autonomy. For other use cases, you can use assistive and generative AI applications. To learn about the differences between AI agents and non-agentic AI applications, see [What is the difference between AI agents, AI assistants, and bots?](https://cloud.google.com/discover/what-are-ai-agents#what-is-the-difference-between-ai-agents-ai-assistants-and-bots)\n",
