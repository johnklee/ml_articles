    "This course is from Udemy <b>[\"Ensemble Machine Learning in Python\"](https://www.udemy.com/course/machine-learning-in-python-random-forest-adaboost/)</b>. This section is coming from [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/machine-learning-in-python-random-forest-adaboost/learn/lecture/6239372?start=30#overview).\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color='green'>Introduction</font>\n",
    "* Machine Learning/AI has become popular in recent years\n",
    "* Amazing results: ML can analyze and predict disease on par with human expert.\n",
    "* AlphaGo/Deep Reinforcement Learning beat world champion at strategy game Go.\n",
    "* Self-driving cars will remove element of human error\n",
    "* Google announced they are \"machine learning first\"\n",
    "* ML is embedded into many different types of products in many industries\n",
    "* Will open up a wide array of career opportunities\n",
    "* Philosophical questions: Can machines think? What is consciousness? Will machines take over the world?\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color='green'>What is this course about?</font>\n",
    "* I assume you've already taken my first Supervised ML course (KNN, decision trees)\n",
    "* This course: combining models\n",
    "* \"Ensemble methods\"\n",
    "* Winners of many contests: Netflix price, Kaggle\n",
    "* Interesting property: as you add complexity, does not overfit easily\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color='darkgreen'>Outline</font>\n",
    "* Bias-variance trade-off\n",
    "* Bootstrap\n",
    "* Bagging (applying bootstrap to ML models)\n",
    "* Random forests\n",
    "* AdaBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color='darkgreen'>Datasets</font>\n",
    "* Classic: house price dataset (regression)\n",
    "* Predicting whether a mushroom is poisonous or edible (classification)\n",
    "* Synthetic data that helps us explore properties of models.\n",
    "* The techniques from this course apply no matter what field you are in/data you are looking at.\n",
    "\n",
    "## <font color='darkblue'>Where to get the Code and Data</font>\n",
    "Repo URL:\n",
    "https://github.com/lazyprogrammer/machine_learning_examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Folder:\n",
    "supervised_class2\n",
    "\n",
    "And you can clone the repo as below:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# git clone https://github.com/lazyprogrammer/machine_learning_examples.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color='darkgreen'>Code yourself first</font>\n",
    "* Try to code yourself first\n",
    "* All code in Github repo has been verified to work, check against that\n",
    "* Practice activities for this course = implementing the algorithms\n",
    "* It's easy to watch the lectures and understand the concepts at a high level\n",
    "* It is hard to understand them so well you can implement the code yourself\n",
    "* But this is what computer scientists DO\n",
    "* Do not watch the videos straight through: you will not remember anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "## <font color='darkblue'>All Data is the Same</font>\n",
    "* How should you practice?\n",
    "* Many people assume \"practice\" constitutes using ML models on specific datasets: predicting price of a house/moving rating / etc.\n",
    "* At this stage, you should be comfortable with the idea that \"all data is the same\"\n",
    "* Doesn't matter what you're predicting\n",
    "* Data is still an NxD matrix (samples x features)\n",
    "* Still preprocess numerical/categorical columns regardless of their \"meaning\"\n",
    "* Meaning of data is irrelevant - logistic regression doesn't care if you're predicting price of a house vs. movie rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color='darkgreen'>What is good practice?</font>\n",
    "* Implementation is good practice\n",
    "* A lot of college courses just do theory and then exams, maybe try to understand behavior of model on a conceptual level.\n",
    "* That's \"ok\" practice\n",
    "* Best is to learn details of an algorithm and then implement it\n",
    "* If you come across an implementation video, you may want to stop and try by yourself first.\n",
    "* Best way to hone your skills.\n",
    "* Using the algorithms on real dataset is useful, I assume you are already doing that\n",
    "* E.g. at your job/lab/ just on something you're interested in.\n",
    "* If not, find something you're interested in\n",
    "* Primary: implementation\n",
    "* Secondary: use on data\n",
    "* We do both in this course\n",
    "* You should try on other datasets as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## <font color='darkblue'>Plug & Play</font>\n",
    "* A lot of people ask \"why is there so much math\"?\n",
    "* Sorry to burst your bubble: machine learning IS math\n",
    "* NOT plug-and-play into Sci-kit Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color='darkgreen'>Plug-and-Play</font>\n",
    "* Especially bad for deep learning, not so bad for classic ML methods and ensemble methods\n",
    "* Ensemble methods are your best bet for a plug-and-play solution\n",
    "* But we already learned how to use SKLearn in my last course\n",
    "* You wouldn't even need to take this course\n",
    "* Your could learn it in 15 minutes, it wouldn't even require a course.\n",
    "* This course is for people who want to know the difference between a decision tree and random forest\n",
    "* API is the same - results are different because theory is different.\n",
    "* At your real job, you will probably plug-and-play all the time\n",
    "* But to be a good data scientist, this would be in addition to learning how the algorithms work\n",
    "* To understand why ensembles are good for plug-and-play, you need theory form this course."
