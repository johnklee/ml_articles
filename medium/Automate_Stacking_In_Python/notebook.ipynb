    "([article source](https://towardsdatascience.com/automate-stacking-in-python-fc3e7834772e)) **Utilizing stacking** (<font color='brown'>stacked generalizations</font>) **is a very hot topic when it comes to pushing your machine learning algorithm to new heights**. For instance, most if not all winning Kaggle submissions nowadays make use of some form of stacking or a variation of it. First introduced in [the 1992 paper Stacked Generalization by David Wolpert](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222467943_Stacked_Generalization), **their main purpose is to reduce the [generalization error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalization_error).** According to Wolpert, they can be understood “as a more sophisticated version of cross-validation”. While Wolpert himself noted at the time that large parts of stacked generalizations are “black art”, it seems that **building larger and larger stacked generalizations win over smaller stacked generalizations. However, as these models keep increasing in size, they also increase in complexity**. Automating the process of building different architectures would significantly simplify this process. The remainder of this article will deal with the [**package vecstack**](https://github.com/vecxoz/vecstack) I recently came across that is attempting just this."

    "## <font color='darkblue'>What Does a Stacked Generalization Look like?</font>\n",
    "**The main idea behind the structure of a stacked generalization is to use one or more first level models, make predictions using these models and then use these predictions as features to fit one or more second level models on top.** To avoid overfitting, cross-validation is usually used to predict the OOF (out-of-fold) part of the training set. There are two different variants available in this package but I’m going to describe ‘Variant A’ in this paragraph. To get the final predictions in this variant, we take the mean or mode of all of our predictions. The whole process can be visualized using this GIF from vecstacks’ documentation:\n",

    "After having taken a look at the documentation, it was time to try using the package myself and see how it works. To do so, I decided to use the [**wine data set available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository**](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine). The problem statement for this data set is to use the 13 features, which all represent different aspects of the wine, to predict from which of three cultivars in Italy the wine was derived.\n",

This step is not significantly different from a regular fit-and-predict in sklearn except for the fact that instead of using `X_train` to train our model, we are using our predictions `S_train`."
